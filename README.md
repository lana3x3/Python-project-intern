Data Analysis and Visualization Using Python (Kaggle Dataset)

1: Setting Up the Environment and Data Exploration

I worked in Kaggle Online (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle and loaded it into a Pandas DataFrame.
I displayed basic information about the dataset: number of rows, columns, and data types.

2: I cleanedÂ the data. 

Handle outliers and skewed distributions.

3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Part 1

I visualized the distribution. 
Explore relationships between features using scatter plots.
Analyze the distribution of categorical variables using bar plots.

4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Part 2

I analyzed time-based trends, if applicable (time series plots).

5: Data Visualization and Reporting

I used advanced visualization techniques, like 3D plots.
